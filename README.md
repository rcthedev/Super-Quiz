# Unit 04 Web APIs Homework: Code Quiz


## Overview

This weeks's coding assignment brought together everything we have learned so far to create an application that is responsive, interactive on multiple levels, and uses the capablities of localStorage. That is, I built a code quiz with multiple-choice questions, a count-down timer, and and a high score leaderboard.

When you click start quiz you will be faced with five questions relating to code that we have been exposed to. As you select each question the application let's you know in real time if you've answered incorrectly or correctly. Incorrect, and your time to answer the rest of the questions is cut by 15 seconds. Correctly, and points are added to your final score! Take too long though and you'll automatically lose the game!

Your initials and score are stored in localStorage to then be printed out the Leaderboard page so you can compare your score to your peers! Frustrated that their score is higher than yours? Clear the whole thing and start over!
